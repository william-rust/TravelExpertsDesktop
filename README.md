SAIT OOSD Threaded Project  - Term 3 - Group 4

Authors: William Rust, Brett Dawson, Harbir Singh

This project is expecting to use the Travel Experts database provided by SAIT,
a copy of the SQL is included in the root folder.

The database connection settings including the expected database user 
are found in the connection file at src/main/resources/connection.properties. 
Modify as needed. We used phpMyAdmin as a database application, this application 
may require modifications to communicate properly with another database application.

Run the application from src/main/java/desktop/team4_desktop/MainApplication.java
